            <p><strong>
                The BoardWalk entertainment district lies along a 0.25 miles (0.40 km) long authentic boardwalk, reminiscent of Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. Guests can rent surreys or bicycles to travel around the Epcot resorts, enjoy classic midway games and street performers, go dancing at the Atlantic Dance Hall or enjoy a "dueling pianos" show at Jellyrolls. The BoardWalk features a wide range of restaurants. The Big River Grille & Brewing Works is the only microbrewery at Walt Disney World, and serves American cuisine along with its unique selection of beers. ESPN Club is a modern sports bar presented by the Disney-owned sports network, complete with broadcast facilities for special events. Kouzzina by celebrity chef Cat Cora offers Mediterranean cuisine for breakfast and dinner. As of December 2014 a new restaurant called Trattoria al Forno, serving family style Italian cuisine opened replacing Kouzzina by Cat Cora.<br>

                <p><strong>
                   <em> Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party </em>is a separate-admission Halloween-themed event held annually during the months of August, September, and October at the Magic Kingdom theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Orlando, and at Disneyland Paris Resort outside Paris, France. The party began as a response to the Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios Florida. Disney's event caters to a traditional family atmosphere, whereas Universal's has more of a "fright-centered" event with their monsters.<br><br>

The event encourages guests to dress up in Halloween costumes and celebrate the season with themed events throughout the park. Regular park rules prohibit guests over the age of fourteen years from dressing in costume, however, this rule is waived for the Halloween event, although adults dressed as a Disney character are prohibited from signing autographs or posing for pictures with other guests.<br><br>

The event begins at 7pm on select nights but guests with a ticket for the event can enter Magic Kingdom beginning at 4pm.<br><br>
