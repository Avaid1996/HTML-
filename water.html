        <u><h2><strong>Disney's River Country</strong></h2></u>
       <p><strong>Disney's River Country was the first water park at Walt Disney World. Located along the shores of Bay Lake and near Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, the park was themed as a rustic, old-fashioned swimming hole. It opened on June 20, 1976, and closed indefinitely on November 2, 2001, with The Walt Disney Company later announcing on January 20, 2005, that the park would remain closed permanently. This made the water park the second of only two Disney parks in the company's history to close permanently, with nearby Discovery Island on the lake closing in 1999. A new hotel, Reflections – A Disney Lakeside Lodge, would be built at the former site of Disney's River Country starting in 2019, and is set to open in 2022.<br><br></strong></p>

        <u><h2 align="middle"><strong>Disney's Typhoon Lagoon</strong></h2></u><br><br><br><br>
        <p><strong>Disney's Typhoon Lagoon is a water theme park located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida near Orlando, and is one of two operating water parks at the resort. It is the second water park to open at the resort, preceded by Disney's River Country which closed in November 2001.<br><br>

            The park, which opened on June 1, 1989, is home to one of the world's largest outdoor wave pools.The theme of the park is the "Disney legend" of a typhoon that wreaked havoc upon a formerly pristine tropical paradise. Ships, fishing gear, and surfboards are strewn about where the storm flung them. Its centerpiece is "Miss Tilly," a shrimp boat impaled upon a mountain named "Mount Mayday" that erupts a 50-foot (15 m) geyser of water every half hour, right before the bells of the watch sound on it. Its mascot is “Lagoona Gator."<br><br>
            
            In 2016, the park admitted approximately 2,277,000 visitors, currently making it the second most visited water park in the world.It operates year-round, with an annual maintenance closure during either the fall or winter. During the closure, its sister park, Blizzard Beach, will remain open.<br><br>

            Of the major parks at Disney World, it is the only one that lies within the city limits of Lake Buena Vista. Blizzard Beach and the four theme parks are within the adjacent city of Bay Lake. However, Lake Buena Vista is the mailing address for the entire Walt Disney World Resort.<br></strong></p>

       <u><h2 align="middle"><strong>Disney's Blizzard Beach</strong></h2></u><br><br><br><br>
       <p><strong>Disney's Blizzard Beach is a water theme park located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando. All water areas are heated (at approximately 80 <sup>°</sup>F or 27 <sup>°</sup>C), with the exception of the melting snow in the ice cave of Cross Country Creek.<br><br>

        The park opened on April 1, 1995 and was the third Walt Disney World water park.In 2016, the park hosted approximately 2,091,000 guests, ranking it the third-most visited water park in the world, behind its sister park, Typhoon Lagoon.Blizzard Beach is open year-round with an annual maintenance closure in the winter. During the closure, its sister park, Typhoon Lagoon, will remain open.<br><br>
        
        The majority of the major attractions at the park are hosted atop of Mount Gushmore, an artificial hill with an elevation of 90 feet (27.4 m). Mount Gushmore is split into three colored slopes to aid guests navigating around the park: Green, Red and Purple.<br><br>
        
        The park's whimsical and imaginative concept was conceived by designer-imagineer Marshall Monroe, who, at the time, was a Creative Executive and Principle Technical Staff at the Walt Disney Company.  Innovative elements of the park include a beach chair themed chair lift, complete with beach umbrellas, and pretend snow skis. The setting and atmosphere of the park are marked by a unique blending of tropical landscaping with simulated melting snow throughout. The mountain is a unique engineering structure constructed in a challenging setting - a high water table Florida woodland. And the architecture is a playful intersection of alpine lodges with Caribbean colors and accents.<br></strong></p>
